Hi there, I am Daniel!

I am a Systems Engineer working for [Amazon Web Services](htps://aws.amazon.com), in Vancouver, Canada. I am from [Manaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manaus) - Brazil, and I moved to South Africa in September of 2016 and then moved to Vancouver, also I am B.Sc. in Computer Science.

I have being contributing to Open Source projects in the last 10 years, most of this time I was involved with [Fedora Project](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Dbruno), where I'm part of the Ambassadors and RPM Packagers groups.

On my spare time, I like to play video game, specifically Playstation 4, where I play two games constantly, that are FIFA and Rainbon Six Siege, but I also like to play other games.
