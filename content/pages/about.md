Summary: About me page

Hi there, I am Daniel!

I work as Systems Engineer on [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront), [AWS's](https://aws.amazon.com) Content Distribution Network, in Vancouver, Canada. I was born and raised in [Manaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manaus) - Brazil. In 2016 I moved to the amazing Cape Town in South Africa, where I started my journey at Amazon Web Services, and then finally I moved to Vancouver in Canada where I am living.

I have being contributing to Open Source projects in the last 10 years, most of this time I was involved with [Fedora Project](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Dbruno), where I'm part of the Ambassadors and RPM Packagers groups.

On my spare time, I like to play video game, specifically Playstation 4, where I play two games more often, that are FIFA and Rainbow Six Siege, but I also like to play other games. If you like to play some of those games, my PSN handle is **danielbrunos**. Also, I like to play football (soccer), actually I play in local amateur league in Vancouver.
