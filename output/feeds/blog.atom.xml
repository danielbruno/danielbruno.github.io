&lt;p&gt;For this new one, I have some ideas of post and topics to write about. I am already working on it, that will be available &lt;em&gt;as soon as possible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I am still working on some improvements for this blog, I will integrate some plugins to get more information about myself and on what I am working on.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
